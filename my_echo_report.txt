My Echo Report
Heidi Blank

What command did you implement?
- I implemented the echo command with the -n flag and the -E flag.

What was a hurdle?
- The biggest hurdle was figuring out the best way to iterate
through the user's input in order to print everything out,
but also implement the flags.

What was easy?
- The easy part was using the print function for everything.
